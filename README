DWConditions.js

DWConditions is used when you need to trigger a callback when several things have completed. For example, if you need to handle updating the interface only when several ajax calls have completed.

Just give it a set of strings for names of conditions. When a condition has been met, call dwconditions.conditionMet.

Does not depend on any other libraries.

Example:

<script src="js/dwconditions.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        
    ...

    function doSomething()
    {
        alert("Success!");
    }

    dwconditions.addConditional("conditionA", "conditionB", "conditionC", doSomething);

    dwconditions.conditionMet("conditionA");
    dwconditions.conditionMet("conditionB");
    dwconditions.conditionMet("conditionC");		// doSomething() will fire now.
